# LinAl-library
This is Python Linear Algebra library made as complimentary learning for **MIT18.06 Linear Algebra
by Prof. Gilbert Strang**.
This makes use of only the ndarray datatype in Numpy and implements the rest using plain Python.
There are a few more functions that are yet to be added into the repository.

## Functions Implemented:
* 4 fundamental subspaces
* Eigen Values and Vectors
* Determinalnts
* Crammers Rule
* Gaus Jordan Elimination
* LU Decomposition
* Gram Schimdt QR Decomposition
* Reduced Row Echelon Form
* Projection Matrices
* Determinant
* Inverse
* Solving Difference Equation

## To be added:
* Fibbonacci Formula using Difference Equation
* Differential Equations
* Markov Matrices
* Fourier Matrices
